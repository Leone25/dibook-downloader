# diBooK download prcedure
Instructions on how to download your Laterza diBook books to pdf for offline use. This only works with books that have the "libroplus" label.

This procedure is very easy and doesn't need any special software, although I advise you to use the Edge browser.
It's very likely that this will be eventually patched. In that case please inform me in issues and I'll try to find a new workaround.

## Steps
1. Login on your [Laterza diBooK page](http://laterzadibook.it/).
2. Click on the book you'd like to download and from the URL copy the last big number.
3. Now open a new tab and paste this link `https://graphiservice.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/pdf/[isbn].pdf` and replace the `[isbn]` part with the number you copyed (It might be handy to use WIN + V to see your clipboard history).
4. Press enter and you'll soon be presented with a prompt asking for a password. The password is `k&WV@E0%Ip6c2WiWG&#R`.
5. Now press on the PRINT button in the pdf viewer and choose "save as PDF" as the printer and save the file somewhere, this will remove the password protection.
6. Enjoy your book.
